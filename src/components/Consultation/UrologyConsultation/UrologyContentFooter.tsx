        Prostate health is another significant concern among men, especially as
        they age. Conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and
        prostate cancer require expert evaluation and management. Urology
        consultants in Bangalore offer prostate screening, PSA
        (Prostate-Specific Antigen) tests, and advanced imaging techniques to
        assess prostate health. Treatments vary from medication and minimally
        invasive therapies to surgical interventions such as TURP (Transurethral
        Resection of the Prostate) for enlarged prostate cases. Early detection
        of prostate cancer is crucial for effective treatment, and urologists
        emphasize regular check-ups and screenings for individuals at risk.

        specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect male
        reproductive health. Factors such as low sperm count, poor sperm
        motility, hormonal imbalances, and varicocele can contribute to
        infertility issues. Urologists conduct semen analysis, hormone tests,
        and genetic screenings to determine the root cause of infertility.
        Treatment options include lifestyle modifications, medication, hormone
        therapy, and surgical procedures to improve fertility outcomes. Many
        urology clinics also offer advanced reproductive technologies such as

        incontinence, and neurogenic bladder disorders. They use urodynamic
        studies, cystoscopy, and imaging tests to assess bladder function and
        develop personalized treatment plans. Depending on the severity of the
        condition, treatment options range from behavioral therapy and
        medication to minimally invasive procedures like sling surgery or Botox
